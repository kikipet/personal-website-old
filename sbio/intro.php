        <p>At the most basic level, viruses are complicated, self-replicating machines made from proteins and nucleic acids that cause trouble for organisms that are actually alive.

            To understand how they work, itâ€™s helpful to know the structures of the viruses themselves and of their proteins. For example, what part of the virus actually binds to its host, and how could we humans prevent that from happening?

        <p>But before diving into that, some general information.</p>
        <p>Viruses can run on either RNA or DNA, single stranded or double stranded. In the Baltimore classification system, they are organized by the nucleic acid they use and their method of replication.</p>
