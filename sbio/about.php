        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Starting in late April of 2018, I have had the honor of studying virology at the Rossmann Lab at Purdue
            University. This is not a standard independent research situation; I have not done any of my own research so
            far during my time at this lab, let alone get anything published. Rather, through weekly meetings I have
            been learning virology and structural biology. In this way, I have been able to establish a solid foundation
            of information from which I can more easily pursue a more specific topic.</p>
