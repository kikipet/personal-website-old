        <h2 style="padding: 1%">Letter from the Paris Opera singers to the author.</h2>
        <p>Dear master, </p>
        <p>You have dedicated a book (<i>Les Soirées de l’orchestre</i>) to your good friends at X***, “a civilized
            city.” This city (in Germany, we know,) probably isn’t more civilized than a lot of others, despite the
            mischievous intent in giving them that epithet. We’re allowed to speculate as to whether their artists are
            really better than ours, and as to their affection for you, it surely can’t be as lively or as old as ours.
            Parisian choruses in general, and those of the Opéra in particular, are devoted to you heart and soul;
            they’ve proven that to you many times in all sorts of ways. Have they ever grumbled about the length of the
            rehearsals, of the rigor of your musical demands, of your violent interrogations, even of your rage, while
            studying the <i>Requiem</i>, <i>Te Deum</i>, <i>Roméo et Juliette</i>, <i>La Damnation de Faust</i>,
            <i>L’Enfance du Christ</i>, etc.?... Never, never. On the contrary, they have always done their job with
            zeal and a steadfast patience. However, you’re not exactly flattering to the men or courteous to the ladies
            during these awful rehearsals.</p>
        <p>When it’s time to start, if the chorus isn’t all here, if someone’s missing, you pace in front of the piano
            like the lion at the Jardin des Plantes in his cage, you growl softly while biting your lower lip, you stare
            daggers at everyone; we greet you, you turn your head away; you sometimes violently hit dissonant chords on
            the piano to show your anger, and you tell us clearly that you are capable of tearing the latecomers and the
            absentees limb from limb… if they were here.</p>
        <p>Then you reproach us for not singing piano enough during the quiet passages, for not attacking the fortes
            together; you want us to pronounce both s’s in the word “angoisse” and the second r in the word “traître”.
            And if one unfortunate illiterate, just one, lost in our ranks, forgets your grammatical observation and
            risks saying “angoise” or “traite” one more time, you lash out at everyone, you overwhelm us with cruel
            jokes, calling us doormen, green room ushers, etc.!! Ah well, we support it nevertheless, and we love you
            all the same, because you love us, we see that, and we understand how much you adore music.
        </p>
        <p>Only the French habit of giving pre-eminence to foreigners could bring you to dedicate your <i>Soirées de
                l’orchestre</i> to German musicians, even though it is a gross injustice to do so.</p>
        <p>It’s done now, let’s not talk about it.</p>
        <p>But why couldn’t you write, at our request, a book of the same genre, maybe less philosophical, more
            cheerful, to dispel the boredom that gnaws at us at the Opéra?</p>
        <p>As you know, during the acts or scenes that don’t include a chorus, we are prisoners backstage. It’s gloomy
            like the entre-pont of a ship, it smells like lamp oil, we can’t sit down; we hear badly told, old moldy
            stories or rancid jokes; or the silence and inaction deaden our brains until we’re told to get on stage...
            Ah! it’s not a pretty job, believe us. Doing dozens of rehearsals to get almost unsingable new songs stuck
            in our heads! Memorizing operas that last from seven to midnight! Changing costume up to six times a night!
            Staying penned up like sheep, when we’re not singing, and not having even five minutes to ourselves during
            those endless performances!!... For we are not like your German artists, who let you perform the pieces
            where they don’t do very much at half-orchestra. We all sing
            all the time. Granted, if we then took the liberty to only sing in the parts we like, cases of angina would
            be rare among the Opéra chorus. In addition, we sing standing up, we’re always on our feet, even when the
            orchestra plays seated in their pit. C’est à devenir huître!</p>
        <p>So, be good, write us a book of real stories, of fabulous tales, of jokes even, like the ones you often write
            when you’re in a bad mood; we’ll read them during our breaks under the light of our lamps; we need to forget
            our sad times, and you will have the right to all of our acknowledgement.
        </p>
        <p>Your loyal sopranos, altos, tenors and basses of the Opéra.
        </p>
        <p>Paris, December 22, 1858.</p>

        <h2 style="padding: 1%">The author's reply.</h2>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
        <p>You greet me: “Dear master”! I was considering responding: “Dear slaves”! For I know how much you’ve been
            stripped of
            leisure and freedom. Wasn’t I a singer back in the day? And at this theater too! God forbid that you enter
            here!</p>
        <p>So I know well the rough labors you complete, the number of (tristes heures) that you’ve counted, and the
            even less
            fortunate salary you are subjected to. Alas! I am not more master, nor more free, nor more joyful than you.
            You work, I
            work, we work to live; and you live, I live, we live to work. The Saint-simonians pretend to know the
            attractive job;
            they have guarded the secret well; I can assure you, that job is as foreign to me as to yourselves. I no
            longer count my
            (tristes heures); they come one after the other, cold and monotone like those drops of melted snow that
            weigh down on
            Paris in sombre silence on winter nights.</p>
        <p>As to my salary, don’t even mention it…</p>
        <p>I acknowledge the validity of your rebuke on the subject of the dedication of the <i>Soirées de
                l’Orchestre</i>; I should have,
            since it is a book on music and musicians, offered it to my friends the artists of Paris. But I came back to
            Germany
            when it struck my fancy to write that book; I was again under the effect of the warm and cordial welcome
            that civilized
            city’s orchestra gave me, and I supposed so little (ugh choppy) to find the least public sympathy for my
            Soirées, that
            to dedicate it to someone was, I felt, to put them under a patronage and not in the least an homage that one
            can be
            flattered by. Your objections to that proposition seem to show that you have a different opinion from mine.
            In your
            belief, there would actually be readers of my prose! I would be mistaken!... I would be an imbecile! That
            fills me with
            joy.</p>
        <p>You tease me for being picky about grammar. I hardly pretend to be an expert in French; I know you know what
            I don’t
            know. But a good number of common words are, I’ll be honest, barbarian, and I can’t stand hearing them. The
            word
            “angoise” is one of them; it is often used by the best paid singers who perform at our opera houses. One
            prize-winning
            student insisted, despite everyone else’s opinion, on saying, “Mortelle angoise!” I went so far as to tell
            her there
            were 3 s’s in the word, hoping that she would pronounce at least two. It worked: she finally sang, “Mortelle
            angoisse!”
        </p>
        <p>You seem to be jealous of the instrumentalists playing seated in the pit, as opposed to standing for long
            hours. Be
            fair. They’re seated, I admit, in the pit where they barely get water to drink, but they’re always playing,
            with no
            rest, no respite, no mercy, not any closer than you to the unrestrait of my friends of the civilized city.
            The directors
            only let them count rests, when be chance the composer gives them rests to count. They play in overtures,
            airs, duets,
            trios, quartets, ensemble pieces, they accompany your choruses; a manager at the Opéra would even like to
            have them play
            in the choruses without accompaniment, pretending that he doesn’t pay them for crossing their arms.
        </p>
        <p>And you know how they’re paid!
        </p>
        <p>They don’t change costumes every half-hour, that’s true; but the obligation to present themselves in a white
            tie is
            ruinous for them. There are some poor fellow musicians at the Opéra who earn, they say, about 66 fr. 65 c.
            per month. At
            fourteen concerts a month, that makes not even 5 fr. per five-hour session; it’s a bit less than 20 sous an
            hour, less
            than for a fiacre. And now they’re striking to be able to dress well. They need at least seven white ties a
            month,
            assuming that they know to keep several clean to use multiple times. And this starching will finish with
            producing a
            pretty round sum. How much does it cost to starch and iron a white tie (without counting the price of the
            tie itself)?
            Fifteen centimes. Let’s admit that the artist abstains, for financial reasons, to have his tie starched, and
            irons it
            for formal occasions only. Those fifteen centimes will then be reduced to two sous. Well, see, it’s
            necessary to write
            the following account at the end of the month:

        <p>Total for fourteen rehearsals and seven ties: 1 f. 55 c.
        </p>
        <p>For a year: 18 f. 60 c.</p>
        <p>For ten years: 186 f.</p>
        <p>These 186 fr., paid by an unfortunate violinist with a family, could give him the appalling need to use the
            last tie to
            hang himself.</p>
        <p>The existence of musicians in an orchestra is sowed in a way resembling a bit more that of roses than of the
            artists in
            choruses; they can give each other their hands. (les uns et les autres peuvent se donner la main.)
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, I would be happy, I can assure you, to soothe your boredom (to quote Molière’s Oronte); but the
            cheerfulness of
            my anecdotes are often problematic, and I wouldn’t dare give way to your friendly pleas, if the most
            depressing things
            didn’t so often have a buffoonish edge. You know what the condemned man says, in a hoarse voice to his
            tearful
            wife, who
            came to say her final farewells and to follow him to the scaffold:</p>
        <p>“You didn’t bring the little one?”</p>
        <p>“Ah! My God! How awful! Could I show him his father at the scaffold?”</p>
        <p>“You’re wrong, it would amuse him, that child.”</p>
        <p>Now, here’s an opuscule where I can’t distinguish the character too well; I’ll name it tentatively: The
            Musical Madhouse
            (Les Grotesques de la musique), as it has mad strangers to the musical art here and there. According to the
            spirit of
            the readers, it could seem ridiculous or deplorable. Try to find some pleasure in reading it; as for me, I
            amused myself
            writing it, undoubtedly like that child of the condemned attending his father’s execution.</p>
        <p>Farewell, ladies and gentlemen; I kiss the hands of the ladies and shake warmly the others, and I pray that
            you always
            believe in the sincere and alive affection from your devoted comrade,</p>
        <p>HECTOR BERLIOZ.</p>
